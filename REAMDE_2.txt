Kiro
Welcome back! Let me remind you where we are with the Photo Organizer project.

Current Status
We've completed the entire spec creation process for the Photo Organizer application:

Requirements Document (.kiro/specs/photo-organizer/requirements.md): Defined user stories and acceptance criteria for the application.

Design Document (.kiro/specs/photo-organizer/design.md): Created a detailed design with architecture, components, interfaces, and data models.

Implementation Plan (.kiro/specs/photo-organizer/tasks.md): Developed a comprehensive task list for implementing the application.

Git Repository: Initialized a git repository and committed all spec files as a checkpoint.

Next Steps
You're now ready to begin implementing the Photo Organizer application based on the spec we created. The next step is to start working on the tasks defined in the implementation plan.

Let's look at the first task in our implementation plan:

tasks.md



The service is experiencing high load. Please try again later.


=> Please continue

<--- back in tasks.md
see swirling arrows at Task 1 !!! very nice 


I'll now help you implement Task 1: Set up project structure and environment. Let's break this down into the subtasks:

Create directory structure for modules
Set up virtual environment and dependencies
Configure development tools (linting, testing)
Create initial git repository and commit (already done)
Let's start with creating the directory structure for our Photo Organizer application:

Command




mkdir -p src/photo_organizer/{models,service


s,utils,ui}
