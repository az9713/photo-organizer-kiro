# Development Notes

## Kiro AI Assistance

This codebase was developed with the assistance of Kiro, an AI assistant and IDE built to assist developers. Kiro provided guidance, code generation, and troubleshooting support throughout the development process, particularly for:

- Creating the core application structure
- Implementing TensorFlow-based image analysis
- Resolving dependency issues
- Generating documentation

## MCP Servers

The development environment utilizes six Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to enhance AI capabilities:

1. **Context7** - Provides access to documentation and technical references for libraries like TensorFlow
2. **Brave Search** - Enables web search capabilities for resolving technical issues
3. **Bright Data** - Offers web scraping and data extraction capabilities
4. **Sequential Thinking** - Supports complex problem-solving through structured thought processes
5. **Basic Memory** - Provides knowledge base functionality for storing and retrieving information
6. **Fetch** - Enables fetching content from URLs for reference and integration

These MCP servers significantly enhanced the development workflow by providing:

- Real-time access to library documentation
- Solutions for dependency issues (particularly TensorFlow on Windows)
- Web-based information for troubleshooting
- Structured approach to complex problem-solving

## Development Environment

The project was developed in a Windows environment using Python virtual environments:

- Primary development in Python 3.10 virtual environment
- TensorFlow 2.10.1 (last version with native Windows GPU support)
- NumPy 1.24.3 (for compatibility with TensorFlow)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (required for TensorFlow on Windows)

## Key Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were addressed during development:

1. **TensorFlow Compatibility** - Resolved issues with TensorFlow DLL loading on Windows
2. **NumPy Version Conflicts** - Identified and fixed compatibility issues between TensorFlow and NumPy 2.x
3. **Image Analysis Performance** - Optimized TensorFlow-based image analysis for better performance
4. **Cross-Platform Support** - Ensured compatibility across different operating systems

## Future Development

Areas for future enhancement include:

- Implementing a full GUI interface
- Adding more sophisticated image categorization algorithms
- Improving parallel processing capabilities
- Enhancing the reporting system with more visualization options
