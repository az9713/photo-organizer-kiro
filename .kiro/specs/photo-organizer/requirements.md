# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Photo Organizer is an application designed to intelligently organize and rename image files based on their content. It analyzes images using computer vision techniques to identify content, group similar images together, and create a logical folder structure. The application supports both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to accommodate different user preferences. It handles various image formats including WebP and provides comprehensive reporting on the reorganization process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Input Handling

**User Story:** As a photographer, I want to be able to select individual images, multiple images, or entire folders for processing, so that I can organize my photo collection with flexibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a single image file THEN the system SHALL process that individual file.
2. WHEN the user selects multiple image files THEN the system SHALL process all selected files.
3. WHEN the user selects a folder THEN the system SHALL process all image files within that folder.
4. WHEN the system encounters image files THEN the system SHALL support common formats including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, BMP, and WebP.
5. WHEN the system encounters non-image files THEN the system SHALL skip them and log their paths.
6. WHEN the system encounters a corrupted image file THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue processing other files.

### Requirement 2: Image Analysis and Categorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to analyze my images and categorize them based on their content, so that similar images are grouped together logically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL analyze image content using computer vision techniques.
2. WHEN analyzing images THEN the system SHALL identify key subjects, scenes, and objects within each image.
3. WHEN categorizing images THEN the system SHALL group similar images based on content similarity.
4. WHEN creating categories THEN the system SHALL minimize the total number of categories while maintaining logical grouping.
5. WHEN grouping images THEN the system SHALL avoid creating folders with only one image unless absolutely necessary.
6. WHEN analyzing images THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including geolocation and timestamp information.

### Requirement 3: Image Reorganization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my images to be reorganized into a new folder structure with descriptive names, so that I can easily find specific photos later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing images THEN the system SHALL create a new folder structure based on image categorization.
2. WHEN creating folders THEN the system SHALL name them descriptively based on the common content of contained images.
3. WHEN reorganizing images THEN the system SHALL rename files based on their content in a human-readable format.
4. WHEN renaming files THEN the system SHALL ensure unique filenames while preserving file extensions.
5. WHEN renaming files THEN the system SHALL limit filename length while maintaining meaningful descriptive names.
6. WHEN creating the folder structure THEN the system SHALL optimize for the smallest number of folders while maintaining logical organization.
7. WHEN reorganizing images THEN the system SHALL create copies of the original files and preserve the originals.

### Requirement 4: Reporting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a detailed report of the reorganization process, so that I can understand how my files were categorized and where they were moved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reorganization process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report.
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include mappings from original filenames to new filenames and locations.
3. WHEN reporting on images THEN the system SHALL include extracted geolocation data in human-readable format (street, city, and country only if outside the United States).
4. WHEN reporting on images THEN the system SHALL include institution names in geolocation data when available (e.g., "The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC").
5. WHEN reporting on images THEN the system SHALL include timestamp information in the format "M/D/YYYY h:MMam/pm" (e.g., "2/8/2025 3:15pm").
6. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL organize file information in a hierarchical structure by folder rather than listing full paths for each image.
7. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on the reorganization (number of processed files, created folders, etc.).
8. WHEN creating the report THEN the system SHALL save it in an easily accessible format (e.g., HTML, PDF, or text).

### Requirement 5: User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want both command-line and graphical interfaces for the application, so that I can choose the most convenient way to organize my photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN the system SHALL provide both CLI and GUI interfaces.
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL support all core functionality through command-line arguments.
3. WHEN using the GUI THEN the system SHALL provide a modern, intuitive interface for all operations.
4. WHEN using either interface THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators during processing.
5. WHEN using the GUI THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality for selecting files and folders.
6. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful default values for all settings.
7. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages.

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user with a large photo collection, I want the application to process my images efficiently, so that I don't have to wait a long time for organization to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple images THEN the system SHALL utilize parallel processing where appropriate.
2. WHEN analyzing large batches of images THEN the system SHALL provide incremental progress updates.
3. WHEN handling large folders THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently to prevent crashes.
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL release all resources properly.
5. WHEN the system is processing files THEN the user SHALL be able to pause, resume, or cancel the operation.

### Requirement 7: Testing and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer or contributor, I want comprehensive tests and documentation, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include unit tests for core functionality.
2. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
3. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include user documentation explaining all features.
4. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include technical documentation for developers.
5. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL include installation and setup instructions.
6. WHEN the project is delivered THEN it SHALL be structured according to best practices for GitHub repositories.
